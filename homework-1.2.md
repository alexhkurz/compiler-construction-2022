# Homework for Lecture 1.2
 
- If you have not done so already, answer Question 3 of [Searching for Strings](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Sk555wUlu). 

- Read the [Introduction to Automata and Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP) up to and excluding nondeterministic finite automata. The most important part is the definition of `run delta` in `automata01`.

- The aim of this exercise is to introduce the most influential textbook on automata and formal languages, the [Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation](http://ce.sharif.edu/courses/94-95/1/ce414-2/resources/root/Text%20Books/Automata/John%20E.%20Hopcroft,%20Rajeev%20Motwani,%20Jeffrey%20D.%20Ullman-Introduction%20to%20Automata%20Theory,%20Languages,%20and%20Computations-Prentice%20Hall%20%282006%29.pdf).

    - Read Section 2.1 of the book for general background.
    - Learn the definitions in Sections 2.2.1-2.2.5 (deterministic finite automaton, extended transition function, language).
    - Read the boxed remark on page 52.
    - Ask any questions you may have about the definitions on the discussion forum.
    - Do the following exercises: 
        - Exercise 2.2.4 
        - Exercise 2.2.10 (the proof is optional)

If you are looking for more practice opportunities make your own variations on Questions 1-3.
